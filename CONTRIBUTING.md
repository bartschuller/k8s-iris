# Contributing to Iris

This is a personal passion project of [Sebastiaan Besselsen](https://github.com/sbesselsen). I am not ready to govern it properly as open source. As per the license, you are free to do whatever you want with the code, but any contributions to the Iris repository itself must be approved by me, and I may reject them for any reason if it does not feel right. If the project and its community should grow, I may revise these standards to be more open and democratic.
